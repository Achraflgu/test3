## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Vercel Does NOT Support PHP!

Your original plan to use Vercel won't work because **Vercel only supports:**
- Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Node.js/Next.js applications
- Serverless functions (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby)

**Your project is PHP** ‚Üí You need a different hosting platform!
